          you might have seen few pages load faster wihtout styles like raw content then you see that the styles are applied, this is because the raw html pages are loaded
          from the server bu these external scripts are loaded from somewhere else(in our case they are from cdnjs), we add absolutely neccesary scripts in the header
          but we can add them anwhere else in the document.

          Babel helps to tranpile our JSX into plain JavaScript.
          Babel is a JavaScript transpiler(in general terms a transpiler is a real world translator(Spanish to English))
          A lot of times we need to write modern javascript and all the browsers do not understand it, so babel converts our modern javascrip into normal javascript
